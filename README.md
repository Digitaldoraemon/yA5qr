# Project Yasur

## --DISCLAIMER--

This is a personal project, which might end up using some other programs like "Unrar" and "Md5". I'll write down how to get some of these softare somewhere soon or later.


### Target settings--

The main focus for this project is to showcase how much a cmd programming can do
It is like a set of assistive tool for batch file, optimizing it for different computers including Linux. 


### Note--

Continue reading for instructions on how to set up properly and basic troubleshooting methods if something goes wrong.


## --Installation Proccess--

**Step 1:** Find a program called "root_installer.bat" inside the project and run it **WITHOUT ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS**

_The program will handle all the error-checking, and will inform you if something goes problematic_

_Shall there be any issues, the program is designed to correct it immediately without notifying the user. Thus ensuring smooth installations._


**Step 2:** The program will ask you if you want the installation to be "recommended" or "custom"

_Recommended: The program will be installed at the default disk, and will install "dynamic installer" and "background op_

_Custom: You will be asked where would you want the program to be saved at, and will be asked what modules you want to be installed_

_Modules:_

_1. Background Op: Install an executable program which will run in background. **ANTIVIRUS WILL THINK THAT IT IS A VIRUS BUT IT'S NOT** _

_2. Dynamic Installer: Instead of installing all the modules, this module is designed to automatically install the required modules for the program you are running. **REQUIRES "BACKGROUND OP" TO BE INSTALLED** _

_3. Auto Detect: _
